# BoundaryDetection
BoundaryDetection is prepared as a part of Google Summer of Code 2018 for RedHen Labs under the mentorship of Anna Bonnazi, Tim Groeling, Francis Steen and Kai Chan. 
The main objective of this project is to segement a TV show recording into its individual shows. The major challenege in this project
was the non existence of a perefect boundary for example: if we consider the case of daily soaps recording, they have a perfect boundary 
accompnied by a theme song, a credit scene, etc. But when it comes to news channel recording the boundary is not that perfect. So,
to overcome this challenge we divided the project into three parts:

1. Audio Analysis.
2. Visual Analysis.
3. Textual Analysis.

Digital Silo is a situation where a large amout of data is inaccessible. For example universities and libraries usually have 
large collection of legacy video recording, which are inaccessible just because of sheer bulks and non organisation structure. This problem
can be solved with the help of BoundaryDetection.
